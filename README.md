# Gluino

Gluino is a lightweight cross-platform framework for building desktop applications with a web GUI.

Similar to other frameworks out there like [Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri) or [Neutralino](https://github.com/neutralinojs/neutralinojs), it uses the OS's built-in browser control on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
